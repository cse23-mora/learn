## Zeroth Law

> If two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third system, then they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other

## First Law 

> Enegy cannot be created and it cannot be destroyed. </br>

“When a system (closed) undergoes a thermodynamic
cycle, sum of the net heat supplied to the system from its
surroundings and the net work input to the system from
its surroundings must equal zero"

$\Sigma Q + \Sigma W = 0 $

$\ Q $ Heat transfer in to the system <br>
$\ W $ Work transfer in to the system

- Heat supplied to the system - POSITIVE
- Work done by the system - POSITIVE
- Heat rejected by the system - NEGATIVE
- Work done on the system - NEGATIVE


### - Corollary

* The internal energy of a closed system remain
unchanged if the system is isolated from its
surrounding

$ \Sigma (Q + W) = \Delta U $  `                      `  if 𝐼𝑓 𝑄 = 0 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑊 = 0 𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑛, ∆𝑈 = 0


### - Corollary
*   For a cycle, the net work done by the system is equal to the net heat added to the system.


 #### Energy balance for closed system: <br>
  $ heat + work = total \space  energy $<br>
  $ Q -W = \Delta E$ <br>
  $Q - W = \Delta U + \Delta KE + \Delta PE$ <br>
  $E = U + \frac{1}{2}mC^2 + mgz$

  $\therefore $ Specific total energy $e = u + \frac{1}{2} C^2 + gz$
