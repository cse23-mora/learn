## Zeroth Law

> If two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third system, then they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other

## First Law 

> Enegy cannot be created and it cannot be destroyed. </br>

“When a system (closed) undergoes a thermodynamic
cycle, sum of the net heat supplied to the system from its
surroundings and the net work input to the system from
its surroundings must equal zero"

$\Sigma Q + \Sigma W = 0 $

$\ Q $ Heat transfer in to the system <br>
$\ W $ Work transfer in to the system

- Heat supplied to the system - POSITIVE
- Work done by the system - POSITIVE
- Heat rejected by the system - NEGATIVE
- Work done on the system - NEGATIVE


### - Corollary

* The internal energy of a closed system remain
unchanged if the system is isolated from its
surrounding

$ \Sigma (Q + W) = \Delta U $  `                      `  if 𝐼𝑓 𝑄 = 0 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑊 = 0 𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑛, ∆𝑈 = 0


### - Corollary
*   For a cycle, the net work done by the system is equal to the net heat added to the system.


 ## Energy balance for closed system: <br>

<br>
  $ heat + work = total \space  energy $<br>
  $ Q -W = \Delta E$ <br>
  $Q - W = \Delta U + \Delta KE + \Delta PE$ <br>
  >$E = U + \frac{1}{2}mC^2 + mgz$ 


  $\therefore $ Specific total energy $e = u + \frac{1}{2} C^2 + gz $

### 1. Flow Work

The work needed to push a fluid element into the CV:

$$
F = P \cdot A
$$

$$
W_{flow} = F \cdot L = P \cdot A \cdot L = P \cdot V
$$

**Per unit mass:**

$$
w_{flow} = P v
$$

where $v = \tfrac{V}{m}$ = specific volume.

### 2. Total Specific Energy of a Flow System

$$
\theta = e + w_{flow}
$$

Expanding:

$$
\theta = u + \tfrac{1}{2}c^2 + gz + Pv
$$

* $u$ = specific internal energy
* $\tfrac{1}{2}c^2$ = kinetic energy per unit mass
* $gz$ = potential energy per unit mass
* $Pv$ = flow work per unit mass

---

### 3. Defining Enthalpy

$$
h = u + Pv
$$

This combines **internal energy + flow work** into one property.

---

### 4. Final Expression

Substituting enthalpy:

$$
\theta = h + \tfrac{1}{2}c^2 + gz
$$

---

**Conclusion:**
The **total specific energy of a flowing fluid** is the sum of its **enthalpy, kinetic energy, and potential energy**.

> $$\left(\begin{array}{c} \text{Total Energy} \\ \text{crossing CV} \\ \text{boundary as} \\ \text{heat and work} \end{array}\right) + \left(\begin{array}{c} \text{Total Energy} \\ \text{of the mass} \\ \text{entering the CV} \end{array}\right) - \left(\begin{array}{c} \text{Total energy} \\ \text{of the mass} \\ \text{leaving the CV} \end{array}\right) = \left(\begin{array}{c} \text{Net change} \\ \text{in energy of} \\ \text{the CV} \end{array}\right)$$

This is then translated into the symbolic equation:
> $$Q - W + \sum m_i \theta_i - \sum m_e \theta_e = \Delta E_{CV}$$




## note
* Transient state  - Change with time
* Steady state - No change with time
* Heat and work depend on the path it followed.
They are called “path functions”.




When steady flow, Net change in energy of the CV is zero.
So 

$$Q - W = \sum m_e \theta_e - \sum m_i \theta_i$$

  

> $$\dot{Q} - \dot{W} = \sum \dot{m}_e \left(h_e + \frac{C_e^2}{2} + gz_e\right) - \sum \dot{m}_i \left(h_i + \frac{C_i^2}{2} + gz_i\right) \text{ kW}$$
