## Thermodynamics Properties


| Intensitive properties<br> (not dependent on mass) |Extensive properties <br> (dependent on mass)| 
|-|-|
| Pressure  | Mass | 
| Temperature  |  |
|Specific enthalpy (h)| Enthalpy (H) |
| Specific volume (v)| Volume (V)   |
|Specific entropy (s)| Entropy (S) |
| Specific heat capacity | Heat capacity|
| Specific internal energy (u)| Internal energy (U)| 


#### * All Properties are point functions (state functions)
####  * Work and Heat are path functions .Therefore, work and heat are not properties of a thermodynamic system; they are path-dependent quantities.


## Thermodynamic Equilibrium

#### for thermodynamic equilibrium, following must be true
1. Mechanical Equilibrium
2. Chemical Equilibrium
3. Phase Equilibrium
4. Thermal Equilibrium



## Common thermodynamic processes
1. Isobaric Process --> Pressure constant
2. Isochoric Process --> Volume constant
3. Isothermal Process --> Temperature constant
4. Adiabatic Process -->  ΔQ =0 (no heat transfer)
5. Isentropic Process --> Entropy constant
6. Polytropic Process --> PV<sup>n</sup> = C ;   n := polytropic index


* $PV^n=C$ </br>
n=0 : Isobaric </br>
n=1 : Isothermal </br>
n -->  ∞: Isochoric


#### *For an isentropic process in an ideal gas
$ PV^γ  = C $ </br>
γ  --> heat capacity ratio </br>
$ γ  = \frac{C_p}{C_v} $   and    $C_p$ > $C_v$</br>
