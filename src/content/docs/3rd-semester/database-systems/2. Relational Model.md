title: Relational Model
description: Understanding the relational database model including attributes, relation schemas, keys, and relationships between tables.

## Attributes
- **Domain:** Set of allowed values for each attribute
- Attribute values are normally atomic
- Attributes can be **null**
## Relation Schema
- $A_1$ , $A_2$ , ... , $A_n$ are attributes
- $R$ =  $A_1$ , $A_2$ , ... , $A_n$  is a relation schema
	- instructor = (ID, name, dept_name, salary)
- The current values of a relation are specified by a table.

- Each row in a table is a tuple
- The order of tuples (order of rows) doesn't matter
## Database
- Database consists of multiple relations
- **Good Design:**
	- Avoid repetition of information
	- Avoid null values
## Keys
- Keys can be used to uniquely identify a tuple (A row in a table)
- K $\subseteq$ R
- A key consists of a subset of elements from a relation schema. (A key can have one or more column)
- **Super Key:** values for K are sufficient to identify all unique tuple of each possible relation
	- Ex: {ID}, {ID,name}
- **Candidate Key:** a minimal super key
	- Ex: {ID}
- **Primary Key:** Any candidate key can be used as a primary key, But it's better to use a meaningful, stable, small key as a primary key
	- It's better to use {ID} as a primary key than {Name} because names are not stable
- **Foreign Key:** A value in one relation appearing in another relation
	- Referencing Relation
	- Referenced Relation
