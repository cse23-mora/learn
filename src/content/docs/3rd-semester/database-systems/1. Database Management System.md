title: Database Management System
description: Introduction to database management systems, their advantages over file systems, and core concepts including data models, abstraction levels, and database architecture.

## Drawbacks of using file systems to store data
### 1. Data redundancy and inconsistency
- Multiple file formats, duplication of information in different files
### 2. Difficulty in accessing data
- Need to write a new program to carry out each new task
### 3. Data isolation - multiple files and formats
### 4. Integrity problems
- Integrity constraints should be implemented in program code rather than stated explicitly
- Hard to add new constraints or change existing ones
### 5. Atomicty of updates
- Failures may leave the database in an inconsistent state
### 6. Concurrent access by multiple users
- Concurrent access needed for performance
- Uncontrolled concurrent access can lead to inconsistencies.
### 7. Security problems
- Hard to do access control
## Levels of abstraction
1. **Physical Level:** Described how a record is stored
2. **Logical Level:** Describe the data and relations
3. **View Level:** Hiding details of data types

## Instances and Schemas
1. **Schema:** Logical structure/plan of the database
	1. **Physical Schema**
	2. **Logical Schema**
2. **Instance:** Content of the database in a particular point in time

### Physical Data independence
Ability to modify physical schema without changing logical schema

## Data Models
- Relational Model
- Entity-Relationship Data model
- Object-Based data model
- Semistructured data model (XML)
### Relational Model
#### Data Manipulation Language (DML)
- Languages for accessing and manipulating data
- DML is also known as query language
	- eg: SQL
- Two classes
	- **Procedural:** Tell **what** data and **how** to get data
	- **Declarative:** Tell **what** is needed without telling how
#### Data Definition Language (DDL)
- Used to define database schema
```sql
create table instructor (
	ID char(5),
	name varchar(20),
	dept_name varchar(20),
	salary numeric(8,2))
```
- DDL compiler generates a set of table templates stored in a data dictionary
- Data dictionary containes metadata
	- Database Schema
	- Integrity constraints
		- Primary key
		- References
	- Authorization
#### Database Design
- Logical Design: Designing schema
- Physical Design: Design Physical layout of database
#### Design Approaches
- Normalization Theory
- Entity Relationship model
	- Modeled as a collection of entities and relationships
### Entity Relationship model

### Object-Relational Data model
- Relational model uses flat and atomic values
	- eg: numbers, strings
- Object-relational model uses object orientation and deal with added data types.
- Allow non atomic types including nested relations
#### XML : Extensible Markup Language
- Ability to create nested tag structures
## Database Engine
1. Storage Manager
2. Query Processing
3. Transaction Manager
### Storage Management
- Manage efficient storage and retrieval of data
- Provide an interface between low level data stored in the database and the application programs.
### Query Processing
1. Parsing and translation
2. Optimization
3. Evaluation
![Query Processing](./images/Pasted%20image%2020250812151110.png)
Alternative ways of evaluating a given query.
- Equivalent expressions
- Different algorithms for each operation
### Transaction Management
- **Transaction :** A collection of operations that performs a single logical function
- Transaction management make sure that the database stays in a consistent state despite system / transaction failures.
- Concurrency control controls the interaction among concurrent transactions
## Database Users and Administrators
- Naive Users
- Application Programmers
- Sophisticated users (analysts)
- Database Administrators

## Database Architecture
Architecture of a database depends on the underlying system
- Centralized
- Client-Server
- Parallel (multi-processor)
- Distributed
